# Shopping Cart Website

I have developed a functional Shopping Cart website using React and React Router DOM. While this project served as a valuable learning experience, there are areas that could benefit from further refinement.

The website's design, while functional, has room for improvement. During the development process, I had the opportunity to explore and implement new techniques, such as leveraging `useOutletContext` and employing various approaches with React Router DOM.
